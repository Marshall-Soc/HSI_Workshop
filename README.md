# A Brief Introduction to Topic Modeling

[Marshall A. Taylor](https://www.marshalltaylor.net)

This repository contains the materials for the "A Brief Introduction to Topic Modeling" mini-workshop, held as part of the [2020 HSI Learning Resilience Conference](https://nmsu-engineering.zohobackstage.com/BuildingHSILearningResilienceintheFaceofCrisis).

## Primary Materials
The primary materials are in the "Topic_Modeling" folder. The contains include the slide deck (topic_models.pdf), the R script to work through the slide deck (topic_models.R), and the U.S. State of the Union presidential addresses (data_corpus_sotu.rda) culled from the `quanteda.corpora` package maintained by [Kenneth Benoit, Kohei Watanabe, and Stefan MÃ¼eller](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda.corpora).

## Secondary Materials
I have also included a *very* brief introduction to R slide deck (intro_R.pdf) and script (intro_R.R) in the "Additional_Materials" folder. Also, for those of you interested in using topic modeling output in a regression context (to, e.g., regress document-topic probability distributions on covariates to model variation in topic prevalence and/or topic content), I included a slide deck (stm.pdf) and R script (stm.R) for a method known as [*structural topic modeling*](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/).
